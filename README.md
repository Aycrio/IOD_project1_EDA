# Netflix Subscription Analysis (2017 Q1 - 2023 Q1) (https://github.com/Aycrio/IOD_project1_EDA)

This project delves into the trends and patterns of Netflix subscription numbers over a span of six years. Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of quarterly report data, I aim to uncover insights in the following areas:

* Used Python, Pandas and Jupypter Notebook for data transformation and data cleaning
* Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and preliminary insights
* Geographic Analysis: Understanding regional subscription dynamics.
* Time Series Analysis: Tracking subscription trends over time.
* Regional Growth: Identifying areas with significant subscription additions or losses.
