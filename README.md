# Netflix Subscription Analysis (2017 Q1 - 2023 Q1) (https://github.com/Aycrio/IOD_project1_EDA)

The data is obtained from Netflix's quarterly financial reports from 2017 Q1 to 2023 Q1
The data for countries' plan price for 2022 is obtained from Comparitech (https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/countries-netflix-cost/)
The data for the pie chart is obtained from Review.org which surveyed 1000 Americans on their streaming habits conducted on February 2023 on their spending habits in the last 6 months

Used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook for data transformation and data cleaning.
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and preliminary insights.

This project delves into the trends and patterns of Netflix subscription numbers over a span of six years. Through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of quarterly report data, I aim to uncover insights in the following areas:

* Geographic Analysis: Understanding regional subscription dynamics.
* Time Series Analysis: Tracking subscription trends over time.
* Regional Growth: Identifying areas with significant subscription additions or losses.
